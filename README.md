Run app.py present in the "production_app" folder.

<h3>Project Objective</h3>
The current app takes in a photo and a list of items which should be present in the order and outputs:
1. Total items detected in the image
2. Items Present
3. Items Missing
4. Items Extra

Currently the inference from Gemini model is not very good, hence this is nowhere close to being solved.

<h3>Roadmap</h3>
1. Detection of grocery quality (fruit ripeness, vegetable blemishes etc.)
2. Classification of fruit quality.
